# Exercise 5: DPLYR Grouped Operations

# Install the nycflights13 package and read it in. Require the dplyr package.
#install.packages("nycflights13")
library(nycflights13)
library(dplyr)

# In which month was the average departure delay the greatest?
# Hint: you'll have to perform a grouping operation before summarizing your data

delay <- flights %>% group_by(month) %>% summarise(delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))

# If you create a data.frame with the columns "month", and "delay" above, you should be able to create 
# a scatterplot by passing it to the 'plot' function

plot(delay)
# In which airport were the average arrival delays the highest?
# Hint: you'll have to perform a grouping operation before summarizing your data

airport <- flights %>% group_by(dest) %>% summarise(delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% arrange(-delay)

### Bonus ###
# Which city was flown to with the highest average speed?

city <- flights %>%  mutate(speed = distance/air_time) %>% group_by(dest) %>% summarise(avg_speed = mean(speed, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% arrange(-avg_speed)
